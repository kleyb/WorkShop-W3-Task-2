# WorkShop Assessment 

A program that analyses a text and counts the number of words , sentences and the frequency of words.

The complete program is on the branch "Assessment 2" , why didn't I merge? Well , the short answer is , my tutor never told me I would need build the same program 3 times in different ways , so instead of creating a new program I kept my work done in class and built on top of it , creating a new branch so I didnt lose both .
 Why not then dividing now ? I like to see the progression of both and seeing where I did something wrong and being able to review my processes.  That's the nice answer , the truth I just had to jump into a new project and left this for another time .
